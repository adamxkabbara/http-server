# http-server
My expedition into understanding how http protocol and servers work.

Some of the core features this project should accomplish:
1. Read a configuration file and apply it to the server
2. Listen to the specified port by opening a socket
3. Read requests from client
4. Open and read the files from the filesystem
5. Send a response back to the client.
